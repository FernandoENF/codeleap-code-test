# CodeLeap - Code Test

This project was made for the code test challenge made by CodeLeap with the job opportunity of Junior Frontend Engineer in mind.


## ‚ú® Features

Besides the requirements of the test, I made additional features like:

- Responsive layout
- Infinite scroll
- Login/Logout
- Modal animations

## üõ†Ô∏è Stack
Besides the core specified libraries (React and Redux), I used my favorite stack to make this project:

**Next.JS, TypeScript and TailwindCSS**

In addition, I used other libraries to code faster with efficiency:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- React-Query
- HeadlessUI
- Axios
- DayJS
- React Hot Toast
